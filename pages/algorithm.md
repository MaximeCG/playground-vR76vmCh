The Algorithm
=============

1.  Make a table one entry for every number between $`2 \leq{n} \leq{limit}`$
2.  Starting at 2, cross out all multiples of 2, not counting 2 itself.
3.  Move up to the next number that hasnâ€™t been crossed out
4.  Repeat Step 2-3 up till $`\sqrt{n}`$

Big O Decomposition
-------------------
The `Sieve of Eratosthenes` algorithm is a time efficient algorithm.

### Time Complexity

```math
\mathcal{O}(n\log{\log{n}})
```

A tradeoff for time however is being made for space.
Unfortunately, this algorithm requires allocating on the order of `n` values.
Since it requires a table of every number to the last integer in memory, the space complexity of sieves generally grows in the order $`\mathcal{O}(n)`$

Visually we can depict each loop removing values from the list of real numbers until all that is left are the primes.

* As a refinement, it is sufficient to mark the numbers up to $`\sqrt{n}`$
