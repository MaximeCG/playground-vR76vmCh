Prime Sieves and Python Data Structures
========================================

One of those recurring problems requires efficiently calculating and testing for prime numbers.
The first algorithm that comes to mind is `The Sieve of Eratosthenes`.

The Sieve, is one of many prime sieves, and is a simple yet time efficient algorithm for finding all the primes below a certain limit.

A prime number is a natural number that has exactly two distinct natural number divisors: 1 and itself.
Make note that we do not consider 1 a prime number albeit also not being composite.

?[Is 2 a prime number](single)
- [x] Yes: It is divisible by itself and 1
- [ ] No: It is a composite
